    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Super simple and delicious one pot salmon rice recipe is perfect to fall face first into after a long day when you don't want to think too hard about what to cook</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>300g balsamati rice</li>
        <li>450ml boiling water</li>
        <li>1 stock cube (veg, fish or chicken)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp rice wine</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp siracha</li>
        <li>2 tsp light soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>2 large salmon fillets - about 150 to 200g each</li>
        <li>4 spring onions finely chopped</li>
        <li>chili oil to serve</li>
        <li>2 fried eggs (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Chuck the rice into a bowl and cover it with water. Stir well and leave for 10 minuites. Tip into a sive and give a good wash. For this dish you want to have the water running clear so most of the starch is out of the rice. This will help it cook faster. Transfer to a saucepan.</li>
        <li>Whisk the water together with the stock cube and then add the rice wine, oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, siracha, light soy sauce, sesame oil and garlic. Pour over the rice and bring the stock to a boil over medium heat</li>
        <li>Add salmon to the pan. Cover and reduce the heat to low. You want the liquid still bubbling. Cook for 20 minutes or until all the liquid has been absorbed and the salmon has just cooked. If the rice needs more cooking time, remove the salmon here so it doesn't overcook.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and let it stand for 5 minutes. Add the spring onions and chili, serve immediately with a fried egg if using.</li>
    </ol>
